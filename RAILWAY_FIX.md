# Railway Deployment Fix

## Issue
Railway was deploying from `python-ai-services/services` instead of `python-ai-services/` root.

## Solution
1. **Deploy from correct directory**: `python-ai-services/` (NOT `python-ai-services/services/`)
2. **Root path should contain**:
   - `main_consolidated.py` ✅
   - `requirements.txt` ✅  
   - `nixpacks.toml` ✅
   - `railway.toml` ✅

## Railway Settings
```bash
# Build & Deploy Settings
Build Path: python-ai-services
Start Command: python main_consolidated.py
```

## Environment Variables Required
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:Funxtion90!@db.nmzuamwzbjlfhbqbvvpf.supabase.co:6543/postgres
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
ENVIRONMENT=production
SOLO_OPERATOR_MODE=true
REQUIRE_AUTH=false
```

The backend should deploy successfully now.
